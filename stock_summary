These companies offer similar wireless services, internet services, and other communication services to customers. While Verizon has a significant advantage in terms of network quality and coverage, these competitors have their own strengths, such as T-Mobile’s focus on customer-friendly policies and AT&T’s bundling of services.

149	Apple	Technology	Conglomerate	US		Jimmy / Sven		10		181	90	142	66	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	"To me, Apple’s moat is their iCloud/iTunes ecosystem. On its own it is a large chunk of the services revenue that has been growing steadily to become a vast enterprise in its own right. It was over $7Bn last quarter and is the size of a Fortune 100 company. It is steadily growing and is largely non-cyclical vs. the very lumpy iPhone revenue. Impressive enough.

The key components are

App Store (monopoly source for all iOS Apps, many Mac OS Apps)
iTunes (media sales, rentals, subscriptions - music, video (tv/movies), books)
iCloud (backup, storage, syncing of all services across all devices)
iMessage/FaceTime (text and voice/video communications)
Siri (digital assistant)
Maps (directions, transit etc.)
Health (data capture/gamification of many health stats)
Photos (library, catalog, metadata, etc.)
Stock Apps (Contacts/Notes/reminders/Stocks/Weather/etc.)
Some of these are revenue generating in their own right (iTunes - 5–10% of purchase price, App Store - 30% of purchase price, Siri - prime position fees from Google, Microsoft etc. iCloud - supplemental storage fees) while others just have cost associated with them. The revenues are high, thought the margins are likely not since the fees generally pay for the running costs of the service.

However, vastly more important than any direct revenue or profits are than this collection of services is what creates the incredibly strong “lock in” to Apple’s ecosystem and consequently the purchase of their products, which is where they make all their profits. It is these services that generally provide the “just works” user experience that engenders such brand loyalty but it is important to note that is is these real benefits that drive the sometimes rabid brand loyalty and not a mental imbalance per competing platform fanboys ;-)

Even if Apple didn’t make some of the best hardware around with the fastest processors, features that work as actually advertised, etc. the vast majority of its users (80%+) are long term users who have all their data committed to the Apple services ecosystem. Years of email, messages, photos, contacts, Apps, tunes, movies etc. all on one or more devices. Not only do these services make movement between Apple devices increasingly seamless, and loss of a device far less catastrophic (via daily cloud backups), it creates incentives to buy more Apple products. If your Mac can receive all its contacts, bookmarks, Messages, photos, mail, etc. from your phone and vice versa without any intervention it gives it a leg up on a Windows machine. Handoff and Continuity functions further increase cross device interaction.

None of this is to say that Apple is unique in this. Google has most of this and sometimes more, Microsoft is increasing its integration between its Windows and other people’s mobile platforms. These are moats for their users, though unlike Apple of course, not for any specific manufacturer of hardware for PC or Android, but none are as financially beneficial as Apple’s which is defending the high revenue, high margin hardware business model that has made Apple one of the largest companies in the world.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-Apples-moat
It is possible to switch platforms and recover much of your data though some easier and some harder export/import efforts but unless there is a real killer feature available on another platform it is too much work to make the change which creates quite the moat against switching. For all the bluster of Apple’s competitors those killer features are few and far between and usually flawed anyway.

It is, of course, vital for Apple to keep making the best hardware to maintain repurchase rates and justify its high prices (which drive the industry crushing margins) but it is nice to be able to do so from behind such a strong moat."	Many of Apple's primary competitors are manufacturers of personal computers. Apple certainly is listed on almost all of the many "top 10" lists for brands, but HP, Acer, Dell, Lenovo, and Toshiba all compete in this space.	29	145	1.76	0.879032258	51.53846154
